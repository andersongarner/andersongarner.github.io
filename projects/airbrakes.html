  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Led the design and development of an active airbrakes system for UVA Rocketry’s 2025 IREC entry, 
    contributing to the team’s <strong>1st Place finish</strong> in the 10k COTS category. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently guiding the next-generation system with enhanced design precision and manufacturability.

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    The rocket required an active drag-control system to reliably target a 10,000 ft apogee. 
    The mechanism needed to be lightweight, structurally sound, and manufacturable under strict deadlines.
  </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I directed the mechanical design effort, creating detailed SolidWorks models 
    and performing FEA simulations to validate structural performance. 
    To meet deployment requirements, I developed a custom curved cam surface 
    that ensured a linear relationship between actuator rotation and fin extension.
  </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    Due to environmental changes at the competition site (lower elevation and higher air density) 
    and increased rocket mass, the system was not deployed to full capability. 
    Nevertheless, the design’s rigor and documentation significantly boosted our technical evaluation scores, 
    securing a <strong>1st Place finish</strong> in the IREC 10k COTS category.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project reinforced the value of precise technical communication across sub-teams 
    and highlighted the trade-offs between simulation fidelity and manufacturing feasibility.
